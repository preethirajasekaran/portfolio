Blackbuck are majestic horned ungulates, endemic to the Indian subcontinent, found primarily in plains, scrubs and grasslands. Territorial blackbuck males display an array of social behaviours - the most of puzzling of which is the lek-mating system. In this system an aggregation of males defend small clustered territories, usually devoid of resources and females visit the lek with the sole purpose of finding a male. 

The main motivation for my study comes from understanding what behavioural aspects may be necessary to maintain lekking behaviour, so that one can develop indices and take conservation measures to ensure that this rare behaviour continues to be preserved in these populations. 

To address this question, we take a behavioural ecological approach. Traditionally, male-male competition has received more attention as a factor driving sexual selection within leks owing to the ease of observation. However, the role of female-choice in this scenario has been largely neglected. How females select males and whether they copy the choice made by other females can impact the evolution of sexually selected traits in males.

In this study, using high-resolution aerial videos, we not only look at female movement with respect to each other but also with respect to male activity patterns.
